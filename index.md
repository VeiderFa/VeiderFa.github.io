## About me <a name="about"></a>

Hello there, I'm Fabian Veider. I am currently doing my PhD in Computational Social Sciences as part of the System Science group at the [University of Graz](https://ess.uni-graz.at/en/about-the-department/management-and-employees/). As part of the interdisciplinary research group [COLIBRI](https://colibri.uni-graz.at/en/doctoral-consortium-complexity-of-life/phd-students/fabian-veider/), I am trying to gain a qualitative and theoretical understanding of polarization and the role of influencers in social systems.<br><br>Also, I am very enthusiastic about beatboxing and taekwondo, where content will be published here in the future.
